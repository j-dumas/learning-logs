# Data Structures and Algorithms in C++
> By Mark Allen Weiss

In my degree I have read this book as additional lectures for a course on the same subject.
Since then, I have nearly forgotten all of the important stuff ...

So I am now reading back parts of this book to relearn the basics of Data Structures to then help me with Leetcode (to use included C++ datastructures instead of redoing them, but still understanding them).
