# Project Logs
### [2025-08-18]
- Scraped the old Python version to start a new C++ version from scratch.
- Will need to setup a container for running a clean Linux machine with Distrobox and later possibly interface with Windows too. At this time I would probably separate OSs concerns so the rest of the project shares the same code
- Will also need to implement a simple tree structure to work with that supports outcome and, later, information sets

#### ðŸ’¡Ideas
- It would be interesting to also have a tool to create trees based on simple rules instead of hardcoding them

#### âœ… Done
- Started this log
