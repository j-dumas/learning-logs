## Summary
---
I am making this simple extensive form game tree vizualiser in C++ with libgraphviz and custom trees to implement common solving techniques, at least the most simple ones. I will be interfacing with Gambit if needed, but they don't have a C++ API. The conversion will probably pass by their EFG file format.

I initially prototyped the project in Python with PyGraphviz, but I felt I wasn't learning enough in terms of programming techniques and architecture to continue with it. The APIs were also weird and slow.

## Goal
---
The goal of this project is to help me visualize game trees to better understand complex games like Stackelberg or stochastic games.
By seeing the shape of the tree, I believe it will also help me better understand equilibria possible actions by players.

Another goal is to start learning common solving techniques and others from articles I've read by implementing them and interface with tools like Gambit to find solutions to more complex games.

> Side goal: develop my C++ and software architecture experience
