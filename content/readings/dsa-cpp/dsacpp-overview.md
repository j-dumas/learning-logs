# Overview
> Data Structures and Algorithms in C++ by Mark Allen Weiss

During my Bachelor degree, I have read this book as additional lectures for a course on the same subject.
Since then, I have nearly forgotten all of the important material ...

I am now reading back parts of this book to relearn the basics of Data Structures to then help me with Leetcode (to use included C++ data structures instead of redoing them, but still understanding them).
